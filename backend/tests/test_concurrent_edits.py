"""Concurrent editing convergence test.

N simulated clients fire random updates against a shared Y.Doc. After the dust
settles, all clients must have byte-identical state.

This is the test that proves Feature 4 of the build spec: CRDT convergence.
pycrdt's job is to make the convergence math correct; ours is to make the
fanout architecture work without losing updates or leaking between rooms.
