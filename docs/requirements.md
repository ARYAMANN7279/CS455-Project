# Concord — Requirements Specification

## Stakeholders
- **Students (primary):** need a shared coding space for pair programming, lab assignments, and demos.
- **Instructors/TAs:** review student code live without taking over the editor.
- **Course staff:** deploy the platform, observe system health, run load tests.

## Functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|---|
| FR1 | Users can sign up, log in, and obtain a JWT. | `POST /auth/signup` and `/auth/login` return 201/200 with a valid token. |
| FR2 | Users can create projects and open collab sessions. | `POST /projects` and `POST /sessions/projects/{id}/sessions` succeed. |
| FR3 | Users can join existing sessions by ID. | `POST /sessions/join/{id}` returns the session and the role. |
| FR4 | Edits propagate to all connected users in <300ms p99. | See §6.1 acceptance test. |
| FR5 | N concurrent random edits converge to identical state on all clients. | `tests/test_concurrent_edits.py` passes for N≥10, 100 edits. |
| FR6 | Snapshots can be created and restored; restore rebroadcasts full state. | `POST /sessions/{id}/snapshots` + `POST /snapshots/{id}/restore` succeed. |
| FR7 | Code runs in an isolated Docker container with resource limits. | `tests/test_sandbox_security.py` passes (network, fork bomb, fs write). |
| FR8 | A user can set breakpoints, run, step, and inspect variables. | Manual demo + `POST /sessions/{id}/breakpoints` round-trip. |
| FR9 | Debug state is broadcast to all session members in real time. | `exec_event` WS messages received by other clients. |
| FR10 | All mutating endpoints enforce role-based permissions. | `tests/test_permissions.py` passes. |
| FR11 | Periodic CRDT checkpoints durably persist document state. | `document_versions` rows appear within 5s of activity. |
| FR12 | The system survives a worker crash mid-execution. | `scripts/chaos.py` shows clean failure + re-run. |

## Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Target | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR1 | Edit propagation latency (intra-region) | <300ms p99 | load_test.py |
| NFR2 | Concurrent users per session | ≥10 without degradation | load_test.py |
| NFR3 | Execution queue wait time | <1s p95 under normal load | metrics page |
| NFR4 | Sandbox escape | None for the documented test set | test_sandbox_security.py |
| NFR5 | TLS for all external traffic | Required for grading demo | Caddy auto-issues cert |
| NFR6 | Cold restart recovers session state | All files reconstructed within 5s | manual + checkpoint_loop |
| NFR7 | CI pipeline runs lint, type check, security, tests | Every PR | .github/workflows/ci.yml |
